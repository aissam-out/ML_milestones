# ML

Hi everyone !

You code with Python & You are new to Machine Learning ? YOU ARE WELCOME

This repository contains python implementations of basic as well as advanced Machine Learning projects every machine learning programmer should be familiar with.

The main goal of sharing these pieces of code here is to bring you with the milestones of a ML project and to provide a cheat sheet of several classical ML problems so that you can rapidly recall basic knowledge and ideas when working on new projects.

Please feel free to make any contribution to make it better.
