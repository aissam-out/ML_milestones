#A step-by-step guide to build a deep neural network.

Here we present all the functions required to build a DeepNN. The 5-layer deepNN implementation is then used for an image classification
case study. It uses a [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]-layer network, with ReLU as activation function in all the layers except the output one (in
which we use Sigmoid).
